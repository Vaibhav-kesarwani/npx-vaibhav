# npx vaibhavv

A Cli based developer card you can run right in your terminal — built with style, personality, and a little bit of JavaScript magic.

##  Run it yourself

You don’t need to install anything. Just open your terminal and type:

```bash

```

This will instantly display my interactive CLI card — complete with my details, links, and some surprises. 🎁
